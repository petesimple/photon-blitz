# Photon Blitz Score System - Development Checklist

## ✅ Phase 1: Immediate UI/UX Fixes
- [ ] Change “Home/Away” to “Player 1/Player 2” as default labels
- [ ] Score buttons update to player names once entered
- [ ] Make score and timeout buttons larger for easier tapping
- [ ] Bring back `Start/Pause Match` text instead of icon
- [ ] Expand player name display width to match timer area
- [ ] Increase spacing in gear menu for better finger access
- [ ] Timeout button: Make bigger and more noticeable
- [ ] Blitz Mode display: Use one line (“Blitz ⚡”) and hide it when match ends or sudden death starts

## 🖥️ Phase 2: Screen/OBS Compatibility View
- [ ] Add horizontal layout mode (for screen display / OBS integration)
- [ ] Allow switching between vertical/mobile and horizontal/OBS layout
- [ ] Player names and timer scaled up for across-the-room visibility
- [ ] Buttons minimized or hidden in screen-view-only mode (ref controls can stay on a separate device)

## 🔊 Phase 3: Audio Enhancements

- [ ] Sound effect at Blitz period start (distinct, short audio cue)
- [ ] Settings toggle in gear menu: Enable/disable sounds

## ⚙️ Phase 4: Misc Improvements & Polish
