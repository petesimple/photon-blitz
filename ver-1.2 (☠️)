## [1.2 (‚ò†Ô∏è)] - 2025-05-16

### ‚ú® Added

- **Sudden Death Skull Mode**  
  If a game ends in sudden death, the losing player gets a ‚ò†Ô∏è skull badge next to their pips. Spooky but fair.

- **`suddenDeathLoser` Tracking Variable**  
  Tracks the loser of a sudden death game so we can accurately shame... we mean *highlight*... their moment.

### üîß Changed

- **`endGame()` Logic Overhaul**  
  Cleaned up logic to distinguish sudden death results vs normal wins.  
  Now it won't sneak in false skulls on non-sudden-death matches.

- **`updateNameDisplays()` Logic**  
  Now honors the `suddenDeathLoser` flag so skulls only show when they‚Äôre supposed to.  
  No more accidental pirate vibes on regular wins.

### ‚úÖ Fixed

- **Skull Display Bugs**  
  Fixed issue where skulls showed up even when sudden death didn‚Äôt happen. No more phantom deaths.

- **Score Swapping Accuracy**  
  `swapSides()` now plays nicer with sudden death outcomes and pips display.
