	•	speak() calls announce critical times and Blitz Mode.

Scoring System:

Blitz Mode:
	•	Auto-triggers at time === 600 (1:00 mark).
	•	Displays banner and calls out “Blitz Blitz Blitz! Double Points!”
	•	Auto-clears if Sudden Death is triggered before time ends.

Timeout System:
	•	startTimeout() pauses the game for 10 seconds and shows a countdown.

Match Control:
	•	endGame(), resetForNextGame(), restartGame(), resetMatch() manage match flow.
	•	Win counts and game results are tracked.

Name Handling & Swapping:
	•	saveNames() saves input to localStorage.
	•	swapSides() reverses players and scores.
	•	updateSummary() builds match results for review.

UI Toggles & Layout:
	•	toggleMenu(): Opens/closes settings gear panel.
	•	toggleLock(): Pins scoreboard to top of screen.
	•	New: Layout Switch Button
	•	Switches between portrait and landscape modes.
	•	⚠️ Displays warning: “Changing layout will reset all game data.”

Audio:
	•	playHorn() plays match end sound.
	•	Sound toggled by gear menu (soundEnabled).
