## 🔥 New in This Version

### 🎮 BLITZ MODE (Live at 60 seconds)
- Double points activate when the timer hits 1:00.
- Banner flashes. Logo hides. Game gets spicy.
- Audio callouts included:  
  _“Ten seconds til Blitz!”_, _“One minute remaining!”_, _“BLITZ! Double points!”_  
  Now your computer heckles you like a caffeinated coach.

### ⏱ TIMEOUTS MADE VISIBLE
- 10-second timeout with an actual countdown on screen.
- Timer changes style and glows. Tap it to cancel. Tap it again if you’re panicking.

### 🧠 SUDDEN DEATH MODE
- Tied at 0:00? The system now declares **Sudden Death**.  
  First score ends it. Voiceover optional. Fear not.

### 🗣 TALKING TIMER (Speech Synthesis)
- The system now *says* time-sensitive alerts.
- Works best when your device is not muted. Works worst when you're losing.

### 🖼 UI POLISH
- Photon logo stays pinned up top—until Blitz Mode eats it alive.
- Version label added just below the gear icon:  
  `ver-1.0 (blitz3)` – classy.
- When settings menu is open, the version label takes a nap.

## 🧪 Reminder: This is Still Beta

We’re calling it `ver-1.0`, but that’s more of a vibe.  
We’re still actively testing this thing. Nothing’s locked.  
Some features might break. Others might evolve.  

In short:  
**Blitz3 is not the final boss.** It’s just the next one in line.

## 👀 What’s Next?
- **Referee Mode?** Maybe.
- **Confetti on Game End?** Probably.
- **Streaming-friendly layouts?** Definitely.
- **Bug-Free Perfection?** *lol no.*

Let us know what feels good, what’s busted, and what could be **even more chaotic**.
